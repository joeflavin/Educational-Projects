## Simple Bash Social-Media Style Messaging System

- Create users, add friends, post on friends' message walls, view message walls
- Uses a client-server architecture
- Communicates using pipes
- Uses flock to avoid concurrency issues


Would be fun to expand:
- run server on a Raspberry Pi for example
- use as a internal messaging system at home
