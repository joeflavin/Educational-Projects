##Java Game System

Simple console based Game System written in Java featuring persistent Users & Scores.

Currently includes 3 Games:
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Bank Craps
- Maths Callenge

Sample `savefile.txt` included to demonstrate persistence. Place the file in `$HOME/.gameSys/`. If the file does not exist it should be created. Feature not tested on macOS or Windows.

Users who partake in a minimum number (set to 3) gaming sessions are promoted to VIP users. These users are awarded bonus points and have fancier display names on the scoreboard.

Feedback welcome.
